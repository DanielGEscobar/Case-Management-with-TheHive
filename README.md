## Steps
1. Setup and Configuration of TheHive
Objective: Install and configure TheHive to serve as the case management platform for security incidents.
Steps:
Install TheHive on a server or cloud instance. TheHive can be deployed using Docker or through a direct installation on Linux.
Configure theHive with basic settings such as user roles, permissions, and access control to ensure only authorized personnel can manage cases.
Set up integrations with other tools such as Cortex (for analysis), MISP (for threat intelligence), and Slack (for notifications).
Configure Elasticsearch as the backend storage system for incident cases and analysis data.
Skills Learned:
Installation and configuration of TheHive on a server.
Integration of TheHive with other cybersecurity tools.
Configuration of user roles and permissions for case management.
2. Integrating TheHive with External Tools
Objective: Integrate TheHive with other security tools to automate data collection, enrichment, and case creation.

Steps:

Integrate SIEM (Splunk): Set up a Splunk search query to automatically send alerts to TheHive when a security incident is detected (e.g., failed logins, malware detections).
MISP Integration: Connect MISP with TheHive to automatically correlate threat intelligence and share IOCs between the two platforms. This will help identify malicious IPs, domains, and file hashes associated with incidents.
Cortex Integration: Configure Cortex to automatically analyze observables (IP addresses, URLs, file hashes) collected from incidents or MISP feeds. Cortex can automatically provide enrichment, such as threat intelligence lookups or malware analysis.
Slack Integration: Set up Slack notifications to alert the team when a new case is created, updated, or closed in TheHive, ensuring quick team responses.
Tools Implemented:

TheHive (case management platform).
Cortex (analysis engine).
MISP (threat intelligence sharing).
Splunk (SIEM integration for alerts).
Slack (real-time alerts and collaboration).
Skills Learned:

Integration of TheHive with external tools (SIEM, MISP, Cortex, Slack).
Automating case creation and enrichment through external data sources.
Real-time alerting and communication for incident management.
3. Automating Case Creation and Enrichment
Objective: Automate the creation and enrichment of cases based on security events.

Steps:

Automate Case Creation from SIEM Alerts (Splunk): Set up automated workflows in Splunk to create cases in TheHive whenever certain high-priority security alerts are triggered (e.g., suspicious activity or malware detection).
Enrich Cases with Threat Intelligence: Automatically pull in threat intelligence from MISP into TheHive cases, enriching the case with relevant IOCs, attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and threat actor profiles.
Run Automated Analysis via Cortex: Use Cortex to analyze observables in real-time and populate TheHive cases with valuable insights (e.g., malicious file hashes, malicious IP addresses, or domain reputation).
Populate Cases with Context: Enrich cases with relevant metadata, such as asset information (using data from OSQuery) and historical event data from Elastic Stack to provide better context for the investigation.
Tools Implemented:

TheHive (automated case management).
Splunk (alert-based case creation).
MISP (IOC and threat intelligence enrichment).
Cortex (automated analysis).
OSQuery (endpoint data collection).
Elastic Stack (historical event data).
Skills Learned:

Automating case creation based on security events.
Automating incident enrichment with threat intelligence.
Analyzing observables and providing context to cases.
4. Investigation and Analysis of Cases
Objective: Use TheHive to manage and track case investigations, ensuring efficient resolution.

Steps:

Assign Cases to Analysts: Create a case management workflow where security analysts can review and investigate new cases assigned to them. TheHive allows analysts to add notes, tags, and tasks related to each case.
Collaborate via Slack: Use Slack for real-time collaboration and notifications. When a case is assigned, Slack can notify the relevant team members, ensuring immediate attention and collaboration.
Track Case Progress: Use TheHive’s case status features (open, in-progress, closed) to track the progress of each investigation. Update cases with findings, analysis results from Cortex, and insights gathered from MISP.
Generate Reports: Once the investigation is complete, generate a detailed case report using the TheHive reporting functionality, summarizing the findings, actions taken, and lessons learned.
Tools Implemented:

TheHive (case tracking, investigation management).
Slack (team collaboration and updates).
Cortex (analysis results integration).
MISP (IOC data and threat intelligence).
